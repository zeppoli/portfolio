# A portfolio I am in the process of creating for myself to show off my projects and skills.

	Hi, welcome to my portfolio. Thanks for checking it out. It's a work in progress right now!
I plan on using HTML and CSS. I already know a lot about JavaScript, but I'm looking to learn more
about Python, so it's a stretch goal of mine to add some functionality and responsiveness to
my portfolio using Python3. Ultimately, I want to deploy the project via Github Pages.

## TODO
- Basic Wireframe
- Design
- Code Wireframe
- Create User Stories
- Code CSS
- Code Python
- Test
- Deploy
